    "# Tutorial: QUA calibration nodes on a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains, with a simple toy example, how to run calibrations on a graph using the *QUA Calibration node*\n",
    "framework. It is based on the code in [hello QUA](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/tree/main/examples/basics/hello-qua)\n",
    "in the [qua-libs](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the QUA calibration nodes is to allow the quantum engineer or experimentalist to build up the\n",
    "quantum machine config required to run an accurate and updated QUA program in an iterative way and to break it down\n",
    "to a manageable series of small and self-contained steps, each within a `QuaCalNode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that `QuaCalNodes`solves is the following: in multiple qubit systems the QUA config becomes a large object\n",
    "that is full of many parameters. These include IF frequencies, waveform samples and mixer correction entries that need to\n",
    "be kept up do date and well-calibrated. Furthermore, when tuning up the system, we're often in experimentation mode\n",
    "so we need a framework that is modular and flexible. `QuaCalNodes`, together with the QPU DB, provide a way to build\n",
    "the QUA config and modify them both automatically and as well as manually when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of QUA (see [qua-libs](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs))\n",
    "and familiarity with the QPU DB\n",
    "(see [section 1](https://github.com/entropy-lab/entropy-qpu/blob/main/docs/qpu_db.ipynb) of the tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUA Calibration nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic idea\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear](linear.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "QUA cal nodes are `PyNodes` which pass the QUA config as input and output. Each QUA cal node performs a calibration\n",
    "measurement and modifies the QUA config with only the values that were calibrated in this node. If needed, the node\n",
    "can also add operations and pulses that are required to perform the calibration. This can be seen in the figure above:\n",
    "We start with a root node, which is a `PyNode` that only passes a bare-bones QUA config (QUA config v0).\n",
    "The next node, time of flight calibration, is a `QuaCalNode` that measures the time of flight to a readout resonator.\n",
    "It updates QPU DB by that value and also modifies the QUA config (becoming QUA config v1), which is passed on to the next node.\n",
    "The next node does the same, and in this manner the config is built up with fresh calibration values, which are concurrently\n",
    "stored in the QPU DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a single QUA node\n",
    "\n",
    "![anatomy](singlenode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look more closely at a single `QuaCalNode`, here time of flight calibration. The node contains 3 methods which\n",
    "are performed sequentially when running the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `prepare_config()`\n",
    "* `run()`\n",
    "* `update_config()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method, `prepare_config()`, is always executed and can be used to add to the config things required for the\n",
    "calibration, such as readout pulses, integration weights etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method, `run()`, performs the actual QUA program and the analysis, and modifies the QPU DB accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method, `update_config()`, takes the values from the QPU DB and updates the QUA config accordingly. For\n",
    "example, here we'd modify the `time_of_flight` field of the resonator.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why `run()` is optional and why we don't just immediately modify TOF in the QUA config. The reason\n",
    "is that we may want to build up the config without actually running the calibration - for example if decide that TOF\n",
    "is sufficiently well calibrated and doesn't need to be re-measured. The decision whether to run a node in a graph or\n",
    "not is determined by the `run_strategy` argument of the entropy `Graph` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging configs\n",
    "\n",
    "![merge](merge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "in many cases, a node can depend on more than one ancestor. In this case, the configs will be automatically merged,\n",
    "as seen above.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If ancestor nodes modify the same config fields, the stored value will be **undetermined**!\n",
    "Please avoid this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework of QPU DB and `QuaCalNodes` is very flexibly by design. If you want, you can add arguments\n",
    "to the class `__init__` method to define run parameters, or, for example, create the full config in the root node\n",
    "and only modify its values, thus skipping `prepare_config()` entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way of using QUA cal nodes, and the config, is as shown here in the tutorial but we really value any\n",
    "feedback and modification suggestions!\n"
